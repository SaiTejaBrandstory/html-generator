                'answer' => 'SaaS PPC is set up for a lengthier and more complicated buyer journey than a typical PPC one. In most cases, SaaS customers need to try out demos, free trials, features, onboarding flows, and pricing models before making a purchase. Therefore, the campaigns have to be optimized for clicks as well as for various conversion events like MQLs, SQLs, product activation, and subscription upgrades. At BrandStory, we create multi-stage funnels to guide users from first interaction to recurring revenue.',

                'answer' => 'Once the perfect targeting is done, landing pages are optimized, and tracking systems are strong, SaaS PPC is able to generate leads in a matter of days. Yet, durable ROI, such as better trial-to-paid conversion rates and lower CAC, is usually only apparent after 6–12 weeks. We do not slow down the pace of this period with our ongoing testing and optimization and at the same time we keep the costs at a reasonable level.',

For the majority of SaaS companies, we advise initiating a paid campaign with a budget that ranges from INR 1,50,000 to 5,00,000 per month, thus accumulating sufficient data for optimization purposes. Consequently, big-brand SaaS companies might need to put in more money. With BrandStory, the focus is on adapting the marketing plan according to your situation - whether you are a startup, in a growth phase or a mature company - thus, making sure that every rupee is spent on tangible results.',
